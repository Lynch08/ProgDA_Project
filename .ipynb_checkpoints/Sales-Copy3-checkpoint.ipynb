    "The real world phenomenon I have chosen to analyse is the the sale of mobile phones across the world. As a person who likes to keep up to date with some of the latest gadgets I decided to research some of the top mobile phone sellers on the plant and generate a dataset featuring some sales data for a simulated provider within a city from each of the top 20 countries in the world for smartphone usage.[[1.]](https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-countries-by-smartphone-penetration-and-users)\n",
    "Mobile phones have become a part of our daily lives - almost a part of our anatomy to the point studies have been done on how peoples stress and anxiety can rise and fall depending on how long they have been without their smartphone or how much battery it has left. I would imagine that this trend, although being highlighted by mental health experts as a major issue within our society, will not decrease anytime soon as many of us have become extremely comfortable living a good portion of both our home and work lives online.  \n",
    "The smartphone industry itself has been an extremly lucritive endevor for those companies that have managed to crack into the market - many smartphone providers have come and gone over the years and some brands that owned the \"brick\" mobile era such as Nokia, have not been able to keep up with the technoligical advances of many of the new major smartphone providers like Apple and Samsung.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Less than half of the world’s total population owned a smart device in 2016, but the smartphone penetration rate has continued climbing, reaching 78.05 percent in 2020. By 2025, it is forecast that almost 87 percent of all mobile users in the United States will own a smartphone, an increase from the 27 percent of mobile users in 2010.\"*[[2.]](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263437/global-smartphone-sales-to-end-users-since-2007/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two brands I mentioned, Apple and Samsung, are by far the most recognisable of smartphone brands (in the western world at least), and both fall into the top 10 brands on the planet with Apple being No.1 and Samsung being No.8.[[3.]](https://www.forbes.com/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands/#706f578119c0) However it should be noted, that list emcompassess all of apples appliances, including tablets, headphones and other accessories, home computing, gaming and so on. This will be discussed more in the analysis stage.  \n",
    "Much of the global data I used when I was trying to analyse global trends I took from a website called [counterpointresearch](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/) [[4.]](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/) The website was informative and gave me a good indication as to the size of the market share of some of these smartphone providers had on a global scale. I did not really know much about the Chinese designer and manufacturer Xiaomi, but it had a market share that rivaled the other top two aformentioned brands - albeit in a different part of the world. Examining the prices of the top models of each brand would be interesting.  \n",

For example I am a big NFL fan, but the fact there is so much data, and that coupled with my knowledge of the intracicies of the game, actually hampered me. I felt I was trying to see how I could make every relationship work, and my coding skills are simply not at that level. Similary I thought about doing a Movie database, again I began overthinking and procrastinating over every factor, how it effected other factors and how I could bring in some smart analysis. In the end I wiped the slate and took a topic I was interested in but had no real world knowledge, this allowed me to discover the trends and relationships on the fly and I felt far more at ease making decisions on what I considered to be more important when simulating the data.  \n",

Now as a note, I would like to say that I do understand that these companines most certainly take into account far more from their sales data than I do here, and I am sure they marry it with other analysis such as raw material prices, global economic outlooks, societal trends and a myriad of other factors when making business decisions. But for the sake of this project where the main goal is to create simulated data I am going to create the dataframe as standalone sales data and try to mirror some of the geographic and market share trends that I have read about durning my research.  \n",

Also I made the decision early that if I felt like there was a factor that I felt could be good to expand the data set I could add it in afterwords.  \n",
    "While it might be relatively simple to simulate a single variable, I believe modelling the real-world correlations between the variables will be the real challange of this project.

    "Simulation has been used throughout history in many fields. In essence the whole theory of simulation is based off one of the founding principles of sentient life, trial and error. Throughout history the \"trial and error\" method was often performed with real-world consequences, eg. medical breakthroughs, weapons testing, chemical testing and so on, were often performed on people or animals or entire ecosystems and environments to gain insight. Because of this, the history of simulation can be written from many perspectives but the benifits of being able to gain insight into a topic using simulated data, that was able to be repetably tested with different tweaks to the tests to see how the outcome changed, is inextricable from the course of human history and in my opinion one of the defining tools that propelled the industrial revolution in the 1800's.\n",
    "For this project we are focused on data simulation and one of the founding simulation methods for data simulation is *The Monte Carlo Methods*. These are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The idea is to use randomness(simulated data) to run repeated tests to solve problems that may be detrministic in principle.[[5.]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) This seems very complex, and it certainly is if you begin to dig into the mathimatical principles that govern some of these algorithms, however there does seem to be a logic behind the methods that is comforting, even if you dont really understand it. Of course that comfort only really comes if you trust that the data is truly simulated with all real-world implications considered, and the results obtained from badly simulated data can, and no doubt have, given spurious results with devestating consequences.  \n",
    "Computer simulations, specifcally in the 20th Century, were spured on by the devestation left behind after two world wars and simulation was seen as a tool to try and explain what happend, and more importantly in most cases, to give governments and superpowers a statistial advantage when decision making if these wars reoccured. However the theory of simulation was spreading far beyond military minds.  Here is a quote from a research paper that I thought sumed up the advent of computer simulation nicely: \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    *\"in the second half of the twentieth century there was a highly fragmented landscape of different actors, questions, goals, and practices rather than a common understanding of “simulation” technology in diverse knowledge domains. Instead, a wide spectrum of mutually unrelated practices which were often, but not always, associated with electronic computers emerged in various disciplinary contexts and were only much later subsumed under the general heading of “computer simulation”. Perhaps even more important is another finding: the “same” computational practices took on distinct epistemic qualities depending on the context of use, disciplinary standards, and background of the protagonists involved.\"*[[6.]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00048-019-00227-6)\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "**1. Cost**  \n",
    "Collecting real world data requires time, money and a variety of other resources, whereas simulated data can be simulated quickly and effiecently using computer programs.  \n",
    "**2. Effiency**  \n",
    "Statistical analysis can be performed on the simulated data in advance or after the collection of real data to examine corrolations, this process can be repeated extremely quickly and as many times as required.   \n",
    "**3. Flexability and Repeatability**  \n",
    "Simulations produce multiple sample outcomes. Experiments can be run by modifying inputs and seeing how this changes the output. Generating a random sample can be repeated, which will allow you to see how often you would expect to get the outcomes you get. Repeating the process gives multiple outcomes which can then be averaged across all simulations.  \n",
    "**4. Trend Idenification and Probabilities**  \n",
    " This is often the end goal of creating simulated data - it allows you to identifiy trends and make probablistic assumptions and sometimes decisions based off the analysis of the data.  \n",
    "**5. Education**  \n",
    "This is more of a personal benifit, but I have found that trying to create this dataset has helped me further my critical thinking and problem solving skills and gives me the tools to be more informed on a topic by using simulated data based off real world research.  \n",
    "**6. More Data**  \n",
    "This may seem obvious, but having more data, especially good data is always an asset - if you think there is too much or some is unneccessary it can be easily removed or limit the sample size. Also simulated data can often breed more data as I learned from this project."

    "Data in general has been a hot topic and really in the public domain over the last two decades, and is getting hotter by the moment. Privacy laws are a blur to me, I am not really sure who understands them, but we are all somewhat aware of the belife that our digital data is being harvested with every keystroke we take on our mobile devices from the apps we all love. This is what I like to call \"real world digital data\" - however many companies, for example investment companies can use a sample of this data and extrapolate the long term probabilities of the direction of a start up by using the trends identified from a small sample of user data and simulating growth potential, operational effiencey and a host of other information. Now of course it is not as simple as that, heavy analysis first has to go into the real world digital data, and things like bias, sociatial norms and trends, public opinion and so on all have to be considered when creating predictive models like that, however it is good simulated data that allows those models to give accurate insights and predictions.  \n",

    "Here I will explain the method of research I did while gathering information to simulate a data set.  \n",
    "At first I was trawling through dousens of datasets in websites like Kaggle and data.com to find one that jumped out to me that I found interesting. As I said above, sports and movies (surprise surprise) were among my top interests, however I did find my knowlege of those topics did kind of work against me as I was seeing connections and corrolations everywhere when I looked at the data sets and when I tried to do some simple code, it got very complex very quickly as I was trying to be too clever and really intrepret the data through the prisim of what I \"knew\" to be true. This type of hubaris did not last long as it became evident quickly that not only was I over complicating the project, I was also allowing my own experiences and opinions bias how I was planning on simulating the data - I had a preconcieved notion of what I was expecting to see.  \n",
    "Because of this I moved onto a topic that I was interested in, but my knowlege of a specific area of the topic was limitied. However as I am writing this I realise that me moving away from a topic because my bias was complicating it, to the topic on Smartphones, is more than a little ironic as that decision was certainly influenced by the fact I have that device within arms reach almost 24 hours a day. \n",
    "The good new for me was there was a trove of data and research alrady done on the sales of Smartphones on both a macro and micro level.  I began by simply googeling \"Worldwide smartphone sales\". This is a good and bad way to start in my opinion, good in the sense you can get a feel for the information out there, bad in the sense there is so much of it, it can be overwhelming and making good decisions as to what is a credible source and not is important.  As I researched the differnet articles and looked at how different graphs presented different data I decided on what I wanted to the data in dataframe to show and the variables I was going to use in that table.  \n",

    "The \"Price Each\" and \"Phone Type\" variables would both have to influence the amount of orders there was for a specific phone - those influences would have to be weighted.  \n",
    "The population density would influence the amount of orders from a specifc city, which would mean certain weights would have to be attributed to the distribution frequency of the variable \"Purchased From: Provider_Country_City\".  \n",
    "The order date/time variable would have to be influenced by the time of year, for example  more phones are purchesed between Nov-Jan rather than any other time of the year as phones are often given as Christmas presents to the young people, and people often wait until the after christmas sales to make a big technological purchase as they may get a deal on a slighly older model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the facts and stats I based my data from:  \n",
    "I used this site: https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities to get the populations of the cites in order to weight the volume of phones purchased by a particular provider in a city.  \n",
    "I also decided to weight the orders by time of year, so more orders would happen around the christmas period.  \n",
    "I also gained insight into the sales trends and market shares using an extremly good site https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/worldwide/#monthly-201907-202207, where I was able to input a month (Back as far as Jan 2007) and end month (to July 2022) and it would give me a graph that displayed the market share a particular provided over time.\n",

    "I was able to play around with this graph and research the trends over different periods.\n",
    "One thing I did notice was that in early 2017 almost all other providers market share dropped, Apple and Samsung were the clear leaders, and the only other provider that was really making any significent positive trends was Xaomi. My simulated data would have to try to reflect this stranglehold the top two companies have on the market.\n"
